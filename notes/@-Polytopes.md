@ polytopes (pronounced: alftheta (alfa-theta) or A.T. “aei tee” ) in STEM (space-time-electro-magnetic) (6D\*\*) space must be constrained by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.



\*\*X,y,z - time -frequency,(amplitude,direction/spin)



Time should be reduced, as it’s a redundant (it’s non-orthogonal). It’s just a guide for parsing/iterating through this space, in a causally-backwards-computable fashion.



(amplitude,direction/spin)=Complex amplitude
