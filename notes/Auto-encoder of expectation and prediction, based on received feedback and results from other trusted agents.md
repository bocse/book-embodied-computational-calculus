Auto-encoder of expectation and prediction, based on results and feedback from other agents
 

Train agents which overlapping subsets of data stream (shard id, not topic id, not context id)

  

Each agent has a:

*   Communicator (encoder, decoder) for interacting with other agents
*   Predictor/actuator/observer
*   Internal simulator/what-if analyzor/schemer&plotter
    
All sharing the same latent spaces, digital memories
And slave pool.

How do you express a typical lookup table as a metric (distance) to be used with lsh/random projections?
