**Reward **(typed intensity) / **expectation-of-fulfillment **(probability) _loop_
**Acceptability** (typed intensity of observable or likely-cognitively-reacheables), as based on **expectation-of-delivery **(probability)/**exploration **(degrees of freedom, surface) loop (deals with budget to experimentation and retesting)


Reward=
Expectation-of-fulfilmment=cached probability-perceived of an events occuring (the (0,1) interval concatenated with {1/alef(i) } and {1/omega(j)} );

Reward can be classified by:
    *   Time-projection
        *   real-time
        *   1 one-work-memory-flash-duration away
        *   2 two-work-memory-flash-duration away
        *   10 ten-work-memory-flash-duration away


    *   Objective-class
        *   P-perceptual closure of loop
        *   C-conceptual closure of loop
        *   R-relational closure of loop
        *   hybrid (\[P\]-\[C\]-\[R\], at-least-two-non-void)
            *   PR -> religion
            *   PC -> art
            *   CR -> ?
