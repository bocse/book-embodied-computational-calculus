Our dictionaries, it seems, enforce or promote a very narrow and narrow-minded definition of the concept “axiom” / “axiomatic”.

<Axiomatic> should read:
“Widely accepted within a convenieng group as true without requiring proof, evidence or futher scrutiny”

Axioms and axioms-enriched with sentient computational capability and bodily/embodiment capability

Axiomatic-centered English from Middle Greek axiōmatikos, andaxiom derived, via Latin, from Greek axiōma("something worthy") andaxios("worthy"). The word axiom can also refer to a statement accepted as true as the basis for argument or inference.
