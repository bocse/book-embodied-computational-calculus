“The Prescient Highway”


Several interpretation:

1. the highway with agents which observe one another in the line-of-sights/points-of-view
2. cells traveling in veins/arteries, in similar conditions to the above case from an spatial-autonomy and visibility point of view
3. pre-observations or propositions for the execution of an evaluation process, given a finite attention spectrum between checkpoints (i.e. choice-points, when assignment of observational tasks is made); tracing the coherence between regions (i.e. pieces) by realizing a balance (including the accounting reconcilliation process) of the statistical inbound and outbound parameters, which are assumed to be of piece-wise pseudo-stationary nature
