The generalization of P vs NP across

-   Different assumptions on causality

-   Different causality on word operations (operations on atomic unit of
    the machine)

-   Different assumption on probability of correct answer

-   Different assumption on the timewise durability of states

Evaluating the optimality (eg. of a chess move) requires an dynamic
understanding or a enactable representation \[of the game world\]

Similarly, evaluating the optimality of a data model, or
algorithm-implementation requires an understanding of the embodiment of
the machine.

This way, for a give program tasked with performing some calculations
over a high-dimensional tensor field one cannot correctly choose either
the memory disposition or the subsequent iteration/scan/random-access
patterns which would be required in the lifecycle of the memory zone,
without specifically having knowledge of the underlying assumption

I need a typing system more closely related to the ability to structure
using the construct-patterns that my mind frequently uses (typed
attributed, field/space of values, typed relationship, typed entity)

I need a string-default language such as markup, to allow for writing
variant code, while highlighting relationships (any of enumeration;
grammatical subordination; attribute owner; shared internal reference;
external reference;)

For writers: Just write, think later. Bottom-up thinking - don\'t
require your brain to make a decision before serializing to output. \#UX

This language needs to be a truss between the analysts and the
technicins, between definition and embodiment.

This language should be allow inserts of binary data, with codec
(representational) or without codec (blind, bitstream), with the purpose
of being embodied in a representation (in active memory, which has
independent policies for sending the information, writing the
information to persistent medium; with or without waiting for
confirmation, respectively for each)

This language should be operable by a machine, at least to a level where
its form can be converted into a multi-graph representation, while any
assets (images, sounds will be tagged with the eventual return value of
the calls to approximators of various manifold-isomorphisms, such as
detectors, classifiers, trackers; the encoded value of its assets will
be said to reside in the latent space ; on the encoding value,
dimensionally-expanding functions will available, as partial, inversions
bijections - the generators)

An end-to-end language assures there are one key, two key and three keys
shortcuts. Workflow: interrupt (key combination) -\> counter (if==5)

-   Semantic-constraints (eg. object types, classes and
    labels/categorical-attributes)

-   Auto-encoding constraints (eg. variational autoencoder for face
    generation)

-   Contextual fields (eg. bordering objects in the scene, lighting of
    the scene -\> light vectors inference for MVP; light-path inference
    for production grade solution )

The Enforcement and Disablement of the Wait-Barriers of Consciousness

When I let all the regions of my brain function independently for longer
amounts of time (eg. increasing the scheduler latency from 5ms to
500ms), I become more creative, but not always more productive. This is
because our understanding of productiveness includes an hidden (not
represented) level of compatibility between the human seen as the
transmitting machine and the computer seen as the receiving machine -
for instance, the ability to type on the keyboard.

\

Creativity and productivity, both independently and in reciprocal
conjunction, are enabled by a lack of interruption. This lack of
interruption permite for higher durability of the memory zones of the
attention context, including all the symbols, representation, entities
and relationships required to be embodied by that context. Conversely, a
state of frequent interruption creates an imperative for the repeated
embodiment and disbodiment of contexts, which is inefficient, from the
point of view of computational yield (i.e. the task of task switching
does not serve function/purpose/fitness-for-purpose, but serves
form/means/fitness-for-use)

\

\#\#

JOURNAL: I have to rethink my schedule

My schedule has too much transit in it and too much communication. Both
of them break the attention span, at different levels (with different
associated expenses for re-achieving the interrupted context).

\

\#\# 

From my childhood, I was biased to think that when it\'s cleaning day
(marked, for instance, by the sound of the vaccuum cleaner) there will
be a day full of interruptions. This is why, until now, I avoided being
at home when my cleaning lady came over.

\

\#\# 

Introspection through non-interruption

A increase in one\'s level of introspection/reflection can be achieved
by accessing a state of uninterrupted (or sufficiently uninterrupted)
existence. One instance of this is dreaming, when the brain rehashes its
own assertion over the world, tests out its intuitions, exercises its
imagination)

\*Is there any trace of presence of DMT in our sleep, at least during
vivid dreams? -\> \#AskANeuroscientist

\

\

\#\# 

The H \> D  existence hypothesis for sentient biases 

The biases of any sentient machine will be concealed at a level of
abstraction higher (H) than the level of introspection/reflection of the
machine is deep (D).

\

\

It follows that, for a well-intended machine, with 

-   a layered error detection and error correction strategy, and

-   with a clear awareness of the balance between scope of assumptions,
    and

-   trusted validation of those assumptions,

that for any bias prompted by a need to serialize an opinion Op1 after
deltaT time of exposure to query Q1, the machine will be biased with

p=FitDistribution\[H / D\]

\

It follows that higher abstraction require more work on behalf of the
sentient to ascertain the trusted validation (through eventually-trusted
peers) to ascertain the reasonable (read: probable to a momentarily
satisfactory degree)

Republica Turing

Several types of HUTMs (Higher-Function Universal Turing Machines)
exist:

The Voyeur Turing Machine (reads the self-reported or externally-assed
state of other Turing machines)

The Exhibitionist Turing Machine (writes its own logs to an external
environment)

The Kirchoff Turing Machine - a Turing machine which is able to
represent\* another Turing machine by writing the whole system of
Kirchhoff (i.e. \"chuch yard\") laws for that machine and solving it for
time or for time-step)

The Doctor/Butcher Turing Machine - a Turing machine which is able to
read that stack dumps, activity logs and profiling snapshots of other
machines

The Taxidermia Machine - is able to cut/stuff new states and transitions
into a living/running Turing machine application. I

The Auto-Taxidermy Turing Machine - is able to cut/stuff new states and
transitions into itself, while living/running.

The Bead-counting Turing Machine - is able to quantize many different
state changes

-   Machine learning algorithms are not actual algorithms per se, in the
    sense that they cannot guarantee either successful or timely
    execution.

-   Probabilistic Oracles: oracles that sometimes have the right answer,
    but that knowledge cannot be held before execution/call of the
    oracle, nor can the correctness of the answer be inferred in some
    small-enough time 

\

(\...)

\

I envisioned a digital land of possibility where there is a Turing
machine. My friend suggested artificial intelligence should not be
thought of as individuals, but as societies. Communities. 

Then I wondered how would this Turing machine act on itself, one several
of its embodiments, before running, while running and after stopping.

So, in honor of Plato\'s Republic, I suggest we call it: \"Republica
Turing\".

The Turing Republic.

Case Study: Why text messaging is wrong - an end-to-end analysis 

\#resist \#revolution 

Time (eg. 1 second) seen as a unit of probabilistic death (1 death / 100
years / 365 days / 24 hours / 3600 seconds ) of the sentient; express
time as the unit of life (or unit of death, depending on +/- sign) 

Measure wait times for consciousness of participants (eg. the time
between buzz and picking up the phone)

Measure the number of external interruptions and count implications
(hand motion, eye motion)

H2H vs H2M2M2H - a comparison of the situation where you spent 3 hours
messaging your 5 closest friends on Whatsapp vs. the situation where you
take one hour to meet, one hour to spend time together and one hour to
return.

Analysis of the situation which fixed and with purposefully-preset
return-destinations.

Analysis of how long it takes to notice a message

-   (buzz, ringtone;

-   on desk/in hand/in pocket;

-    while
    sitting/sitting-at-desk/standing/standing-on-transport/walking) ;

we can measure all this by making a Knosis sampler app;

Digital Awareness Day: We need a \#GoOffline day in the year
\#NoDigitalDay \#GoOfflineDay: no LCDs, no cash, no GPS, no credit cards
(cash only)

The monopoly of big tech (sustained by the moorian monopoly of Intel,
the spiderweb of knowledge and ?broken-trust of Silicon Valley, the
greed of Wall Street, the backwardness and mental sloth of Congreess)
has spawned a situation where the entire tribe is incentivized to find
new ways to hack and overload the communication bandwidth of the tribe,
with little or no regard for the meaning or the consequence of the
messages which already overcrowd that bandwidth.

\

\

\#\#\[description of book\]

The thesis of the book is that there is no fundamental difference
between humans and embodied Turing machine equipped with some external
peripheral devices (storage, communication, combinatorial/discrete
optimization, field/manifold optimization)

The work is pursuing a constructivist view on artificial intelligence,
based in math and stemming from the branch cuts\* of physics,
psychology, computer science and neuroscience.

\

\#\#In this project, we present an analysis of epidemic spread through
flight routes modeled with SIS (Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible). The
purpose of this study is to analyse network properties in order to find
the best way to slow down a very infectious disease, focusing only on
flight transportation and the contamination of people on large
distances. We try to use network properties to find the appropriate way
to mitigate the development of a widespread disease, without breaking
down the network completely.
