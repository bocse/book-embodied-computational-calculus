Expectation/prediction-observation/correction-intention/realization tripartite uncertainty minimization and enacted-objective pursuit

{ (e,p) ; (o,c) ; (i,r) } - the set of adversarial pairs

While unobserved (hidden) and acting as de facto perceived constraints ( d |K , d |Q ) id also a slow-changing adversarial pair



{ 𝛿 \[ x \] / 𝛿 \[ y \] } x { (e,p) ; (o,c) ; (i,r) } - cross-referenced differential perception (includes co-observation and cross-observation)



The principle of quickest expected commitment/certainty/save-game/floor-price/guaranteed-minimum

The application of this principle is proportional to the sentient’s relatedness to hunger or lower-Maslow-layer inbound preconditions (needs) unfulfillment
